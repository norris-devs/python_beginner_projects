# Python Beginner Projects

These are my first Python exercises.  
Mini Greeting App - asks for the user's name and age, and then prints a friendly response.
Fast Thinking Part I & II - tests our agentic thinking abilities, represented as System 1 and System 2 in my programs.
Through this project, I practiced using:
- print()  
- input()  
- if/else statements
- time modules
- lists

## About me
I'm currently learning Python fundamentals and plan to expand my skills toward web development and creative software projects.
