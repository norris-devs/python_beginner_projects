# Mini Greeting App

This is my first interactive Python program.  
It asks for the user's name and age, and then prints a friendly response.  
Through this project, I practiced using:
- print()  
- input()  
- if/else statements  

## About me
I'm currently learning Python fundamentals and plan to expand my skills toward web development and creative software projects.
